# A short description on the order of the commands:
# In order to avoid problems considering CORS requests I'm building everything
# in one Docker image (except the database). This is far from optimal and causes
# too many fs layers. As a last resort I have moved less frequently chaning parts
# to top and more frequently chaning parts (source code) to the bottom. That's it.
